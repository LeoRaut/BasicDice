# BasicDice
A basic dice simulator for 'Age of Sigmar' tabletop game

I created a simple 5 slide pitch to discuss the premise for this project, as well as the app's functionality and methodology.

If you're having trouble generating output remember to:
1. Make sure you've pressed the submit button after switching between the two output tabs.
2. Make sure your inputs have no extra characters or spaces in them
3. When simulating random dice (e.g. D3 attacks) write it out with a lowercase d. E.g. d3, d6, 2d6.
